This definition indicates that if function f(n) is Ω(g(n)), it means that f(n) grows at least as fast as g(n), but it does not provide an in-depth explanation of the significance or full details of Ω-notation.

To fully explain Ω-notation and its significance, we would need additional context beyond what is provided. However, based on common knowledge:

Ω-notation (Big Omega notation) is used in computer science to describe the lower bound of a function's complexity. It represents the best-case scenario for how fast or slow an algorithm can run. Specifically:
- f(n) = Ω(g(n)) means there exist positive constants c and n0 such that 0 ≤ cg(n) ≤ f(n) for all n ≥ n0.
- This indicates that f(n) grows at least as fast as g(n).

The significance of Ω-notation lies in its ability to provide a lower bound on the growth rate of an algorithm, which helps in understanding the minimum resources required by an algorithm.

\[ T(n) = aT\left(\frac{n}{b}\right) + f(n) \]

Here:
- \( a = 2 \)
- \( b = 2 \)
- \( f(n) = n \)

Next, we need to determine which case of the Master Theorem applies:

1. **Case 1**: If \( f(n) = O(n^{\log_b a - \epsilon}) \) for some constant \( \epsilon > 0 \), then \( T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a}) \).

2. **Case 2**: If \( f(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a}) \), then \( T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a} \cdot \log n) \).

3. **Case 3**: If \( f(n) = \Omega(n^{\log_b a + \epsilon}) \) for some constant \( \epsilon > 0 \), and if \( af\left(\frac{n}{b}\right) \leq cf(n) \) for some constant \( c < 1 \) and all sufficiently large \( n \), then \( T(n) = \Theta(f(n)) \).

For our recurrence relation:
- \( a = 2 \)
- \( b = 2 \)
- \( f(n) = n \)

We have:

\[ \log_b a = \log_2 2 = 1 \]

Now, we compare \( f(n) = n \) with \( n^{\log_b a} = n^1 = n \):

- Since \( f(n) = n = n^1 \), this fits the condition for **Case 2** of the Master Theorem.

Therefore, according to Case 2:

\[ T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a} \cdot \log n) = \Theta(n \cdot \log n) \]

So, the solution to the recurrence relation \( T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n \) is:
